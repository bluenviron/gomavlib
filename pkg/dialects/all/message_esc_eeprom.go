// ESC EEPROM data message for reading and writing ESC configuration.
// Supports multiple ESC firmware types including AM32, Bluejay, and BLHeli32.
// ESC data is read by sending the MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE with `param1=292` and `param2=esc_index`, where esc_index is the zero-indexed ESC number for the corresponding motor, and 255 is used to request data for all ESC.
// The message can be sent to set the ESC value.
// For write requests, a bitmask allows selective writing of specific bytes to avoid corrupting unchanged values.
// The data format is opaque to the autopilot.
// A GCS is required to understand the format in order to create an appropriate UI for display and setting configuration values, and to inform users when the ESC uses an unsupported data format.
// Note that for AM32 EEPROMs the data layout is defined in: https://github.com/am32-firmware/AM32/blob/main/Inc/eeprom.h (the second byte in the structure is the eeprom_version).
// The firmware field indicates which ESC firmware is in use, allowing the GCS to interpret the data correctly.
