// Sets the home position.
// 	The home position is the default position that the system will return to and land on.
// The position is set automatically by the system during the takeoff (and may also be set using this message).
// The global and local positions encode the position in the respective coordinate frames, while the q parameter encodes the orientation of the surface.
// Under normal conditions it describes the heading and terrain slope, which can be used by the aircraft to adjust the approach.
// The approach 3D vector describes the point to which the system should fly in normal flight mode and then perform a landing sequence along the vector.
// Note: the current home position may be emitted in a HOME_POSITION message on request (using MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE with param1=242).
