	// Command is valid, but execution has failed. This is used to indicate any non-temporary or unexpected problem, i.e. any problem that must be fixed before the command can succeed/be retried. For example, attempting to write a file when out of memory, attempting to arm when sensors are not calibrated, etc.

	// Command is valid and is being executed. This will be followed by further progress updates, i.e. the component may send further COMMAND_ACK messages with result MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS (at a rate decided by the implementation), and must terminate by sending a COMMAND_ACK message with final result of the operation. The COMMAND_ACK.progress field can be used to indicate the progress of the operation.

	// Command has been cancelled (as a result of receiving a COMMAND_CANCEL message).
