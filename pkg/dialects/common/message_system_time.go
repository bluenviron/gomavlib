// The system time is the time of the master clock.
// This can be emitted by flight controllers, onboard computers, or other components in the MAVLink network.
// Components that are using a less reliable time source, such as a battery-backed real time clock, can choose to match their system clock to that of a SYSTEM_TYPE that indicates a more recent time.
// This allows more broadly accurate date stamping of logs, and so on.
// If precise time synchronization is needed then use TIMESYNC instead.

	// Timestamp (UNIX epoch time).
