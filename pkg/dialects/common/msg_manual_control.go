	Target uint8
	// X-axis, normalized to the range [-1000,1000]. A value of INT16_MAX indicates that this axis is invalid. Generally corresponds to forward(1000)-backward(-1000) movement on a joystick and the pitch of a vehicle.
	X int16
	// Y-axis, normalized to the range [-1000,1000]. A value of INT16_MAX indicates that this axis is invalid. Generally corresponds to left(-1000)-right(1000) movement on a joystick and the roll of a vehicle.
	Y int16
	// Z-axis, normalized to the range [-1000,1000]. A value of INT16_MAX indicates that this axis is invalid. Generally corresponds to a separate slider movement with maximum being 1000 and minimum being -1000 on a joystick and the thrust of a vehicle. Positive values are positive thrust, negative values are negative thrust.
	Z int16
	// R-axis, normalized to the range [-1000,1000]. A value of INT16_MAX indicates that this axis is invalid. Generally corresponds to a twisting of the joystick, with counter-clockwise being 1000 and clockwise being -1000, and the yaw of a vehicle.
	R int16
	// A bitfield corresponding to the joystick buttons' 0-15 current state, 1 for pressed, 0 for released. The lowest bit corresponds to Button 1.
	Buttons uint16
	// A bitfield corresponding to the joystick buttons' 16-31 current state, 1 for pressed, 0 for released. The lowest bit corresponds to Button 16.
	Buttons2 uint16 `mavext:"true"`
	// Set bits to 1 to indicate which of the following extension fields contain valid data: bit 0: pitch, bit 1: roll.
	EnabledExtensions uint8 `mavext:"true"`
	// Pitch-only-axis, normalized to the range [-1000,1000]. Generally corresponds to pitch on vehicles with additional degrees of freedom. Valid if bit 0 of enabled_extensions field is set. Set to 0 if invalid.
	S int16 `mavext:"true"`
	// Roll-only-axis, normalized to the range [-1000,1000]. Generally corresponds to roll on vehicles with additional degrees of freedom. Valid if bit 1 of enabled_extensions field is set. Set to 0 if invalid.
	T int16 `mavext:"true"`
