// Set a parameter value (write new value to permanent storage).
// The receiving component should acknowledge the new parameter value by broadcasting a PARAM_VALUE message (broadcasting ensures that multiple GCS all have an up-to-date list of all parameters). If the sending GCS did not receive a PARAM_VALUE within its timeout time, it should re-send the PARAM_SET message. The parameter microservice is documented at https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html.
// PARAM_SET may also be called within the context of a transaction (started with MAV_CMD_PARAM_TRANSACTION). Within a transaction the receiving component should respond with PARAM_ACK_TRANSACTION to the setter component (instead of broadcasting PARAM_VALUE), and PARAM_SET should be re-sent if this is ACK not received.
