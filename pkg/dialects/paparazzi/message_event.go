// Event message. Each new event from a particular component gets a new sequence number. The same message might be sent multiple times if (re-)requested. Most events are broadcast, some can be specific to a target component (as receivers keep track of the sequence for missed events, all events need to be broadcast. Thus we use destination_component instead of target_component).
