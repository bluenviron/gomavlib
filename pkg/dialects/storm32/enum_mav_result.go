This will be followed by further progress updates, i.e. the component may send further COMMAND_ACK messages with result MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS (at a rate decided by the implementation), and must terminate by sending a COMMAND_ACK message with final result of the operation. The COMMAND_ACK.progress field can be used to indicate the progress of the operation.
