// Send a secure command. Data should be signed with a private key corresponding with a public key known to the recipient.

For SECURE_COMMAND_GET_SESSION_KEY the session key should be zero length. The data array consists of the data followed by the signature. The sum of the data_length and the sig_length cannot be more than 220. The format of the data is command specific.
