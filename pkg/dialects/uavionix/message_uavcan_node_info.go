// General information describing a particular UAVCAN node. Please refer to the definition of the UAVCAN service "uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo" for the background information. This message should be emitted by the system whenever a new node appears online, or an existing node reboots. Additionally, it can be emitted upon request from the other end of the MAVLink channel (see MAV_CMD_UAVCAN_GET_NODE_INFO). It is also not prohibited to emit this message unconditionally at a low frequency. The UAVCAN specification is available at http://uavcan.org.
